    "# I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll implement several local search algorithms and test them on the [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) (TSP) between a few dozen US state capitals.  Briefly, the TSP is an optimization problem that seeks to find the shortest path passing through every city exactly once.  In our example the TSP path is defined to start and end in the same city (so the path is a closed loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Local search algorithms are important in artificial intelligence because many tasks can be represented as [optimization problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem).  For example, [here](https://blog.openai.com/evolution-strategies/) researches used evolutionary strategies to perform gradient-free training of deep neural networks (which allows non-differentiable activation and loss functions), and [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/seq2seq/BeamSearchDecoder) is an example of using beam search for tasks like optimal sentence translation in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TSP problem itself is interesting and has been studied extensively because it can be applied to a variety of useful real-world problems. It has been used in logistics & operations research for vehicle routing and order-picking in warehouses, product development and design like computer wiring & printed circuit board masking, and various scheduling problems, among others.\n",

    "## I. Representing the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to build a representation of the problem domain.  The choice of representation can have a significant impact on the performance of the various optimization algorithms.  Since the TSP deals with a closed loop that visits each city in a list once, we will represent each city by a tuple containing the city name and its position specified by an (x,y) location on a grid: (<NAME>, (x, y)).  The _state_ will then consist of an ordered sequence of the cities in the path. In other words, the path is defined as the sequence generated by traveling from each city in the list to the next in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the path ((\"City1\", (x1, y1)), (\"City2\", (x2, y2)), (\"City3\", (x3, y3))) defines a circuit from City1 -> City2 -> City3 -> City1. "
